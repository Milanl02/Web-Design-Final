        <h1 class="title">OUR LEGACY</h1>
        <h2 class="paragraph">In 1900, the Dodge Brothers Company was founded by brothers, John and Horace Dodge, in Niles, Michigan. John and Horace Dodge had success within the automobile industry from a very young age, working with Henry Ford to create automotive parts for Ford vehicles. Because of this, the Dodge Brothers were offered a 10% stake in the company and a contract to mass produce parts for the Ford Model-T. After a long 10 years of building Ford’s success with their vehicles, the Dodge Brothers decided to terminate the partnership and establish their own brand of vehicles. No official reason for leaving Ford was given by the brothers, but many speculate to believe that the Dodge Brothers left to prevent loyalty to one brand of vehicle manufacture.</h2>
        <h2 class="paragraph">July 17th, 1914, the Dodge Brothers established their new company and began designing and selling their own branded vehicles. With previous found success from manufacturing Ford parts, John and Horace had no issues selling their first vehicle, the Dodge Model 30-35 Touring Car. Everyone knew about the Brothers and their reputation to make quality and reliable vehicles. Dodge dealers quickly began to sprout all around the country as 22,000 applications for dealerships were submitted before the Model 30 was even produced. The Dodge Brothers continued making vehicles for the general public, even making winterized vehicles that contained windows and hard-tops. The Dodge Brothers quickly made their brand and foundation on dependability.</h2>
